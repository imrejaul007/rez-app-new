/**
 * Aggregated store selector index.
 *
 * Each per-store selector file lives next to this one. Splitting the original
 * monolithic `stores/selectors.ts` into one file per store (NA-HIGH-24) means a
 * circular import in any single store only breaks that store's selectors, not
 * every screen that uses any selector.
 *
 * Back-compat: `stores/selectors.ts` re-exports everything from this index so
 * the 200+ existing call sites (`from '@/stores/selectors'`) continue to work
 * unchanged.
